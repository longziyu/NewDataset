subtitle: Baselinesï¼š
Social LSTM: It is the pioneering data-driven method for the trajectory prediction task. The motion pattern of each pedestrian is modeled with an LSTM. And the hidden states of pedestrians are pooled with neighboring pedestrians at each time-step using a pooling mechanism, namely, Social Pooling, which achieves modeling social interactions.

Social GAN: It is the first generative model based method for the pedestrian trajectory prediction task. Generative Adversarial Network is used to generate more socially-acceptable trajectories. And a new pooling mechanism is proposed to model social interactions. 

STGAT: It is one of the first graph based method for the pedestrian trajectory prediction task. The social interactions between pedestrians are modeled by a graph structure and then captured by the Graph Attention Networks. And it also uses two LSTMs to capture spatial and temporal dynamics.

STAR: It is the first transformer based framework for the trajectory prediction task, which tackles the motion patterns and social interactions by only attention mechanism. STAR captures complex spatio-temporal interactions by interleaving between spatial and temporal Transformers.
